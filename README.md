### Instruction Manuel

- install with `bash -c "bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcristol/Fried-Fish-Shell/master/install.bash)"`
- uninstall with `bash -c "bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcristol/Fried-Fish-Shell/master/uninstall.bash)"`


### TODO

- [] Consider what things are installed when running the install
- [] look into the benefits of go and how it compares to a framework like spring boot
- [] change the fish_functions file to yaml form
- [] rewrite the fried_fish_scribe as a bash program

### Ideas
#### Features
- Installs nvim and aliases vim -> nvim
- Installs fish shell expects brew to be installed
- Installs fisher and fish plugins that I think are necessary like z
- Installs oh my fish for a dope theme 
- Prompts the user to change their default shell and edit /etc/shells
- Points to the fish cookbook that will tell them how to use fish

### Josh only features ~ Spicy Fried Fish Shell
